    <h1>🧑‍🚀 Revanth Test Page!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to this Astro-powered site. This started as the official
      Astro blog starter template and is now evolving into a home for
      systems-focused work in AI infrastructure and agentic architectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next iterations, this page will become a focused landing
      zone for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Production-style agentic systems and evaluation projects</li>
      <li>Long-form writing on agentic architectures, infra, and observability</li>
      <li>A clear snapshot of current focus and active experiments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For now, treat this as the scaffolding step: we’ve set up the dark,
      centered layout shell. Next, we’ll turn this into a proper hero
      and “current focus” section.
