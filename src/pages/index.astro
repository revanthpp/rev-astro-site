    <h1>DEBUG: Revanth Test Page</h1>
    <p>
      This is a temporary debug version of the home page to confirm the new
      dark layout shell is wired correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once this is stable, we’ll replace this with a proper hero,
      current-focus section, and a snapshot of key work.
